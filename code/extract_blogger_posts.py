"""
Script to extract published blog posts from a Blogger XML export.

Purpose:
- Parses a Blogger XML archive to extract only original published posts (excluding drafts and comments).
- Saves each post as an individual text file in a specified output directory.

Key Design Choices:
- Uses XML parsing to identify entries categorized as blog posts (`kind#post`).
- Skips drafts by checking the `<blogger:draft>` tag.
- Extracts the title, URL, and content of each post and saves them in separate files.
- Generates filenames based on sanitized post titles to avoid issues with special characters.

Important Considerations:
- Requires two command-line arguments: input XML file and output directory.
- Creates the output directory if it doesnâ€™t exist.
- Handles missing links or content gracefully.

This instruction block should always be included at the top of the script to maintain context for future modifications.
