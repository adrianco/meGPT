# Code to assist in pre-processing content to share

Archive downloads from web content services often contain private information, drafts etc. These scripts extract the sharable content.

## Content Processors
- **Twitter archive** - extract just conversation tweets (ignoring standalone tweets, DMs etc)
- **Medium archive** - extract text of posts, skipping drafts
- **Blogger archive** - extract text of posts, skipping comments and drafts
- **YouTube processor** - handles individual videos, playlists, and entire channels
- **Book processor** - extracts text from PDFs with page range selection and summary generation
- **Story processor** - processes narrative content with optional PDF attachments
- **Podcast processor** - downloads and processes audio content with transcription

## Enhanced Features
- **File kind processing** - automatically processes directory-based content archives
- **URL extraction** - finds and processes URLs from various text file formats
- **Summary generation** - creates AI-generated summaries using BART model
- **Content deduplication** - prevents processing the same content multiple times
- **MCP integration** - generates Machine Context Protocol resources for AI applications

Podcast websites are hard to parse, need to find and download the audio file first, then process it
An audio file of the author speaking is provided to help identify who is who

Videos and podcasts on youtube are easier to download.

Content generated by these scripts should be saved in the authors/<author_name> directory and uploaded to the repo
