# Code to assist in pre-processing content to share

Archive downloads from web content services often contain private information, drafts etc. These scripts extract the sharable content.

- Twitter archive - extract just conversation tweets (ignoring standalone tweets, DMs etc)
- Medium archive - extract text of posts, skipping drafts
- Blogger archive - extract text of posts, skipping comments and drafts

Podcast websites are hard to parse, need to find and download the audio file first, then process it
An audio file of the author speaking is provided to help identify who is who

Videos and podcasts on youtube are easier to download.

Content generated by these scripts should be saved in the authors/<author_name> directory and uploaded to the repo
