# Whitepapers Format

This directory contains technical whitepapers and reports. The expected format is:

1. Files should be in PDF format
2. Naming convention: `topic_year.pdf` (e.g., `performance_2023.pdf`)
3. Each whitepaper should include:
   - Executive Summary
   - Technical Details
   - Methodology
   - Results/Findings
   - Recommendations
   - References

## Example Structure

```
whitepapers/
├── performance_2023.pdf
├── security_best_practices_2023.pdf
└── cloud_migration_2023.pdf
```

## Content Guidelines

- Use clear, technical writing
- Include diagrams and charts where appropriate
- Provide concrete examples and case studies
- Include methodology and testing details
- Reference industry standards and research
- Include author contact information

Note: This sample directory contains only this README. In a real author's directory, this would contain actual PDF whitepapers.
