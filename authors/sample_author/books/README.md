# Book Content Format

This directory should contain PDF files of books or book chapters. The expected format is:

1. Full books should be named according to their title, e.g., `cloud_native_patterns.pdf`
2. Individual chapters should include chapter numbers, e.g., `cloud_native_patterns_ch3.pdf`
3. Book excerpts should indicate the page range, e.g., `cloud_native_patterns_p45-67.pdf`

## Metadata Requirements

Each PDF should have proper metadata including:
- Title
- Author(s)
- Publication Date
- Publisher
- ISBN (if applicable)
- Copyright information

## Example Structure

```
books/
├── cloud_native_patterns.pdf           # Full book
├── cloud_native_patterns_ch3.pdf      # Single chapter
└── cloud_native_patterns_p45-67.pdf   # Page range excerpt
```

Note: Due to copyright restrictions, this sample directory contains only this README. In a real author's directory, this would contain actual PDF files of books or chapters that the author has permission to share.
