Title: Performance Testing Best Practices
URL: https://sample-author.blogspot.com/performance-testing

Performance testing is a critical aspect of software development that often gets overlooked until it's too late. Here are some best practices I've developed over years of experience.

1. Start Early
   - Include performance tests in your CI/CD pipeline
   - Set baseline metrics early in development
   - Monitor trends over time

2. Test Real-World Scenarios
   - Use production-like data volumes
   - Simulate realistic user behavior
   - Include network latency and constraints

3. Key Metrics to Monitor
   - Response Time
   - Throughput
   - Error Rate
   - Resource Utilization
   - Concurrent Users

4. Common Pitfalls to Avoid
   - Testing in isolation
   - Ignoring cleanup between tests
   - Using unrealistic data
   - Not accounting for external dependencies

Remember to document your performance test results and maintain historical data for trend analysis. This helps in identifying performance regressions early.
