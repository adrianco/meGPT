Hi Joe, thanks for the comment. I agree there is a lot of inertia. My point was really that you can see where disruption is going to happen eventually, but it’s not usually possible to predict when it’s going to happen. Trends are sometimes slow and linear but often have tipping points where a hard to predict individual event or person can accelerate change. For example if the Icelandic Pirate Party won an election and implemented direct democracy there would be a real test of the concept, if they don’t win then it remains theoretical and has much less influence. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_Party_(Iceland)
