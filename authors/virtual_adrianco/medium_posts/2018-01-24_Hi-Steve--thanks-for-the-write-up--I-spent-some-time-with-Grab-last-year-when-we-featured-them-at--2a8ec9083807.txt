Hi Steve, thanks for the write-up, I spent some time with Grab last year when we featured them at the AWS Summit Singapore and I agree it’s a good culture with a nice technology stack and they are doing very well. We’re looking forward to seeing what you get up to, and let me or anyone at AWS know how we can help. Best wishes!
