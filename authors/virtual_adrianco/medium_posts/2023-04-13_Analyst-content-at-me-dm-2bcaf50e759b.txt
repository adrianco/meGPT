Analyst content at me.dm

Medium launched me.dm a while ago as a gateway to the fediverse, but I haven’t seen much activity there. Posting here, I don’t see a Toot option, alongside the Tweet/Facebook options. Anyway since I have a separate account from my main account at @adrianco@mastodon.social that lives @adrianco@me.dm I decided to try and use it differently and just posted an analyst oriented tweet thread about Tesla, Rivian etc. https://me.dm/@adrianco/110190420885431817
