Thanks for summarizing the differences, but I don’t see where your conclusion comes from. There’s some aspects of ECS — multi-AZ support, network management and production use at large scale — that I could argue are over a year ahead of Kubernetes, and there are several features where it’s behind. Blox is an open source vehicle for AWS to collaborate with its customers and add the features they want, without giving up on integration with VPC, IAM and multi-AZ support.
