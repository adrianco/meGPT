<a href="http://http://perfcap.blogspot.com/2010/05/netflix-in-cloud-and-html5.html">I posted on this subject a while ago</a>, and generated a lot of confused comments, who read things into my post that weren't there. Today I hope it's a bit clearer what I was talking about, because we released the Netflix iPhone app, which is based on HTML5 for its user interface elements, back ends into the Amazon cloud, and uses conventional, non-HTML5 video playback and DRM. The playback mechanism is the same as the iPad, but to support the scale of expected usage we needed more capacity (it's currently the top free app in the app store as I write this) and we got that by rebuilding our API tier and personalized movie choosing backend to run on the Amazon cloud. The user interface runs in a webkit based browser window in the app, just like on iPad, but the entire UI is built using Javascript with advanced CSS and HTML5 animations to get it to feel like a native iPhone app.<br /><br />Returning to the theme of my last post, Netflix is hiring engineers to work on cloud tools, platforms and performance, and advanced user interfaces. I think we are breaking new ground  in both areas and its an exciting place to be. We have very high standards and are looking for the best people in the industry to come and help us...
