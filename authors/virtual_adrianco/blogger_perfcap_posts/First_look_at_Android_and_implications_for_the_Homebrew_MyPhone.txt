Title: First look at Android and implications for the Homebrew MyPhone
URL: https://perfcap.blogspot.com/2007/11/first-look-at-android-and-implications.html

Google's new <a href="http://code.google.com/android/download.html">Android SDK</a> is a lot more than a Linux distribution, its a complete and documented application framework with developer tools support. The primary language for application development is Java, with a special runtime called the Dalvik virtual machine that is designed to run efficiently on a battery powered device.<br /><br />The SDK is 55MB, there is available Eclipse support.<br /><br />Sample applications include Google Maps, mail, webkit based browserÂ and the usual Phone and PIM stuff. The <a href="http://code.google.com/android/reference/view-gallery.html">user interface</a> seems to be based on a new set of Java classes, but there is also direct access to the display in C/C++ using SGL for 2D and OpenGL ES for 3D, and audio and video players for things like mp3 and H.264.<br /><br />From a first pass through the docs, a lot of work has gone into this already. It looks as if it should be portable<br />to a homebrew phone without much difficulty, and from then on, we are likely to be leveraging a much larger community than the other open alternatives. It appears that the current state of the <a href="http://www.openmoko.org">OpenMoko</a> project is that they have made some progress and have a somewhat usable toolkit written in Python, but that C/C++ development based on GTK+ is painful, and documentation is scarce. It looks to me as if Android has taken the same basic inspiration as OpenMoko, but with a much more professional execution, and with a Java based developer platform.<br /><br />We will be discussing this at the <a href="http://hbmobile.org/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page">Homebrew Mobile Phone club meeting on Wednesday</a>. We are holding the meeting at Mozilla's offices and will also be discussing their work on a mobile version of the Mozilla browser.
