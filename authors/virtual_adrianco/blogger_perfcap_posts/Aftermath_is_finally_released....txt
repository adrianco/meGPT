After many years of listening to this song evolve from an initial concept to its final released form, its now time to share it with the world and find out what everyone else thinks of it. Its a moving reaction to the events and aftermath of 911, sounds like nothing else, and has an odd but catchy hook.<br /><br />Its available on Fractal's site at <a href=http://fractal.bebo.com>fractal.bebo.com</a> and via the <a href="http://www.ijigg.com/songs/V2CFF4DPD">iJigg widget below</a>.<br /><br /><object width="315" height="80"><param name="movie" value="http://www.ijigg.com/jiggPlayer.swf?songID=V2CFF4DPD&Autoplay=0"><param name="scale" value="noscale" /><param name="wmode" value="transparent"><embed src="http://www.ijigg.com/jiggPlayer.swf?Autoplay=0&songID=V2CFF4DPD" width="315" height="80"  scale="noscale" wmode="transparent"></embed></object>
