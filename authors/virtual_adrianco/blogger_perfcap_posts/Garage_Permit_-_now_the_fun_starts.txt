Title: Garage Permit - now the fun starts

I went into the county office and picked up the permit, paid them some more money to cover their costs of inspecting the work as we do it. They gave me back one of the marked up copies of the final site and building plans, and the permit sheet, and I stopped off at a Fedex office to get several copies made. Next stop is Tuffshed, to talk to the foreman who gets it built, and the concrete contractor (Jose Amaya Concrete of Morgan Hill) who normally works with Tuffshed. Jose is available immediately so we may actually get going fairly quickly. First step is to mark out the foundation and pour it.<br /><br />The new septic tank connection pipe is going in today and being inspected tomorrow.
