URL: https://perfcap.blogspot.com/2008/02/millicomputing-at-bil-this-weekend.html

I'm presenting (and generally helping out) at the <a href="http://www.bilconference.com">BIL un-conference</a> this weekend in Monterey. I have posted some slides on my <a href="http://millicomputing.blogspot.com/2008/02/bil-talk-millicomputing-future-in-your.html">Millicomputing</a> blog, on the subject of "The Future in Your Pocket", that speculates on what could happen over the next few years in the mobile space, and starts a discussion of what we might be able to use it for.
