Title: Slingbox for Xmas

What new toys can we get this Xmas? I already have the stuff I need. I'd like a phone with Wifi and 3G network speeds and a touch screen, but my Treo 650 is OK until something better comes along. I'm curious to see what Apple may come up with next year, in the much rumoured iPhone.<br /><br />I've had a Tivo since 1999, and I'd like to be able to view the programs elsewhere in the house or further afield. The Slingbox does this, lets me control the Tivo remotely and stream the programs to a Windows or OSX laptop. The Slingbox AV was $179 list price on their web site, but I had a look on shopping.com and found it for sale from an out of state vendor for $140 with free shipping and no tax. So that's going to be the new toy this Xmas....
