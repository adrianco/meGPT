Title: Starting a new role at Battery Ventures
URL: https://perfcap.blogspot.com/2014/01/starting-new-role-at-battery-ventures.html

Careful what you wish for. Take some side interests and activities that
aren't central to your real job, have a bit too much fun with them,
mention to <a href="http://www.battery.com/our-team/member/mike-dauber/" target="_blank">a friend</a> that it would be cool to do them for real, and have
him convince his company to create a completely new position tailored for
you that they've never had before, and haven't heard of anyone else doing. In a week.<br />
<br />
Over the last few years I've given a lot of talks, and the industry&nbsp;reaction to Netflix's all-in public cloud strategy has evolved from <i>"It&nbsp;won't work"</i> through <i>"It only works for unicorns like Netflix"</i> to <i>"How do&nbsp;we get there?"</i> My answer to that question is the Netflix Open Source&nbsp;Software (NetflixOSS) platform, consisting of around forty distinct&nbsp;projects shared at <a href="http://netflix.github.com/" target="_blank">netflix.github.com</a> that provides an on-ramp for&nbsp;applications to move to a cloud native architecture.<br />
<br />
I have presented aspects of this work to different audiences at public&nbsp;conferences, private events and directly within companies. For developers,&nbsp;I concentrated on explaining the NetflixOSS components, DevOps and&nbsp;continuous delivery patterns. For managers I concentrated on how an open&nbsp;source and cloud native strategy delivers rapid product evolution,&nbsp;scalability and high availability. As interest from individual companies&nbsp;grew it became clear that there was an opportunity to take what I had&nbsp;learned and apply it directly to a wider audience.<br />

In my new role at&nbsp;Battery Ventures I will be continuing my conversations with large&nbsp;enterprise companies planning a move to cloud native, and SaaS vendors who&nbsp;are re-architecting for scale, to understand the gaps and demands of this&nbsp;market. With that context I will work in the Battery Ventures team that is&nbsp;looking for opportunities to fund companies who are enabling the&nbsp;transformation of enterprise IT, and I will also provide advice and&nbsp;mentoring for portfolio companies.<br />
<br />
The role is called <i>Technology Fellow</i>. It's different to the short term&nbsp;Entrepreneur in Residence (EIR) position, and is similar to full time investing staff.&nbsp;Battery just raised their tenth fund, and have a total of $900M to invest.&nbsp;My job is to help spend that wisely and get the best return. That also&nbsp;means even more conference presentations, more international coverage, and&nbsp;a broader range of subjects to discuss.<br />
<br />
I will no longer explain how Netflix works, so the starting point for my&nbsp;new presentation materials is going to be something like <a href="http://perfcap.blogspot.com/2013/12/velocity-and-volume-speed-wins-keynote.html" target="_blank">my Flowcon talk</a>&nbsp;with the Netflix specific parts removed. If you still want a Netflix&nbsp;Architecture overview talk, start with <a href="https://twitter.com/jedberg" target="_blank">@jedberg</a>, he's a very highly rated&nbsp;speaker, and he can also connect you to the many excellent speakers at&nbsp;Netflix that cover their own specific areas.<br />
<br />
ItÂ¹s going to take me a little while to figure out the new role, but a big&nbsp;part of the job is meeting lots of people. I'm taking bookings for&nbsp;February...<br />
