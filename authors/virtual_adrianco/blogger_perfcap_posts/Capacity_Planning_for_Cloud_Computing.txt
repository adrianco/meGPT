I have a head start, in 2002 and 2003 I led projects at Sun where I researched how to do Capacity Planning in Virtualized Datacenters, built some tools, filed a couple of patents, presented papers at conferences and failed to get Sun's N1 project to implement some of it. Well, it seems I was a few years ahead of my time, so I'm going to start by digging out the papers I published at the time.
