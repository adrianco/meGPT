The Ads are making a bit more sense now...<br /><br />There is a <a href="http://www.boingo.com">global commercial WiFi service that has good coverage in places like Hotels and Airports called Boingo</a>. They aggregate services that are not branded under their own name, but if you have a Boingo account you can use the service. Last month they announced a deal to include <a href="http://www.fon.com">FON in their network</a>, more than doubling the number of access points to a few hundred thousand. This month they announced an annual flat rate plan for $39 per month. Very cool! Global WiFi access at a low flat rate.<br /><br />I'm posting a series of updates at <a href="http://www.millicomputing.com">Millicomputing.com</a> that describe a detailed design for an Enterprise server Millicluster. Its a radical improvement in terms of performance per watt and performance per dollar for some kinds of applications.
