Today the new leach-field pipe was inspected, and the foundations were dug, I did a stop-motion video using iStopMotion on an old MacOS laptop looking down from the house, and most of the day's work is compressed into one minute.<br /><br /><object width="420" height="255"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Qy_CpzdjxHI&hl=en_US&fs=1&"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Qy_CpzdjxHI&hl=en_US&fs=1&" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="420" height="255"></embed></object><br /><br />Tomorrow they will do the detailed preparations for the pour on Monday of the garage slab itself (6" thick), perimeter foundation (at least 18" deep, more on the downhill side where it is on in-fill), a walkway down the side of the garage, an "apron" in front of the garage to park on, and pads for the propane tank and generator.
