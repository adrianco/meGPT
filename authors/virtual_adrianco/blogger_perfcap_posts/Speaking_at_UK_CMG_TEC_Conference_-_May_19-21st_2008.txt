<a href="http://www.ukcmg.org.uk/acJune2008conference.html">UKCMG TEC 2008</a> is near Northampton in the UK. I'm giving two of the same presentations as I gave at the US CMG, the enterprise version of my <a href="http://www.millicomputing.com">Millicomputing</a> talk, and a half day workshop on Unix/Linux Performance.<br /><br />My old friend Phil Harman is also giving a talk on DTrace, and I'm staying in the UK for a few days after the conference to catch up with friends and family.
