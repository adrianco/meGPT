Title: Computer Measurement Group - CMG07 - San Diego - December 2-7
URL: https://perfcap.blogspot.com/2007/11/computer-measurement-group-cmg07-san.html

As usual I will be presenting at <a href="http://www.cmg.org">CMG07</a>. I have attended every year since 1994, and its the place where I keep track of new developments in the performance management tools industry, as well as learning and sharing with my peers.<br /><br />CMG moves around the US, last year it was in Reno NV, before that in Orlando FL.<br /><br />On Sunday 2nd December there is a workshop day. I'm co-presenting (with Mario Jauvin) a half day tutorial on Capacity Planning and Performance Monitoring with Free Tools (for the third year). We updated our slides a bit more this year to track the latest versions of the free tools.<br /><br />During the week I'm giving a new paper on Millicomputing, that introduces the concepts I have been discussing on my <a href="http://www.millicomputing.com/">Millicomputing blog</a>, and talks about some of the management challenges of managing large numbers of small computers.<br /><br />I'm also giving a half day training class on Unix/Linux Performance Management, which is based on the materials I developed over many years in my books and talks. It is still somewhat biased towards Solaris since I know that better, but I have been adding more on Linux and AIX as that is the world I currently live in at work (Netflix runs RedHat Linux and AIX on IBM P-series) and in my Millicomputing sideline (I run Ubuntu on my development host and linux 2.6 on my gumstix).<br /><br />The conference contains a wide range of content, there is:<br /><ul id=""><li>a large vendor exhibition showing the latest tools, vendor presentations and user group meetings to talk about their next steps.<br /></li><li>everything from beginner level introductions to deep mathematical theory.</li><li>coverage of networking, storage, CPUs, application level performance.<br /></li><li>discussion of Linux, Solaris, AIX, Windows, Mainframe and all combinations</li><li>panel discussions on virtualization, service oriented architectures, scaling large sites</li></ul><div>I hope to see some of my readers there. I used to give training classes for Sun on a regular basis, and this is now the main venue for me to present updates versions of those classes.</div><div><br /></div>
