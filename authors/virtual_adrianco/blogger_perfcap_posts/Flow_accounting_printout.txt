Title: Flow accounting printout
URL: https://perfcap.blogspot.com/2005/04/flow-accounting-printout.html

I went to edit the code and realized that I hadn't finished some previous work, so I added a printout of the flow accounting data, an example is shown below.<br /><br />The timestamp is the start of the flow, I translate to local timezone and show that as well. I difference the two timestamps to get the duration of the flow in seconds; add the uid and project id (which are only present for outbound flows); show the protocol; decode the IP addresses and look them up as names if possible, along with their port numbers; list the number of packets and bytes in the flow; and end with the filter name from the ipqos definition.<br /><br /><pre><span style="font-size:78%;">timestamp  locltime dur   uid  proj prot           srcip:port            dstip:port  npkts  nbytes aname<br />1113850483 11:54:43  13     0     0  tcp   66.102.15.100:80               crun:55783    21    4148  acct<br />1113850483 11:54:43  13   100    10  tcp            crun:55783   66.102.15.100:80       13   15082  acct<br />1113850483 11:54:43  13     0     0  tcp            crun:55783   66.102.15.100:80        6     240  acct<br />1113850480 11:54:40  16   100    10  tcp            crun:55782   66.102.15.101:80        3    1253  acct<br />1113850480 11:54:40  16     0     0  tcp            crun:55782   66.102.15.101:80        7     280  acct</span><br /></pre>
