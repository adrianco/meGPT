Title: Netflix in the Cloud
URL: https://perfcap.blogspot.com/2010/10/netflix-in-cloud.html

I'm presenting this talk on Thursday at the Cloud Computing Meetup, and again on Nov 3rd at QConSF. So far I have posted a "teaser" <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/adrianco/netflix-oncloudteaser">summary on slideshare.</a> After QCon I will post the full slide deck [update: <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/adrianco/netflix-on-cloud-combined-slides-for-dev-and-ops">combined deck from both talks posted here</a>].<br /><br /><a href="http://www.meetup.com/cloudcomputing/calendar/14476942/">The meetup is the "beta test" of the presentation</a>. It's in Mountain View at "Hacker Dojo", and at the time of writing 437 people have signed up to attend. If everyone turns up it's going to be crazy and over-flowing trying to park and get in, so get there early.... I will focus the meetup talk more on the operational aspects of the cloud architecture, and migration techniques.<br /><br /><a href="http://qconsf.com/sf2010/presentation/Running+Netflix+in+the+Cloud">At QConSF, the presentation is in the "Architectures you've always wondered about" track</a>, and I will spend more time talking about the software architecture.<br /><br />Why give these talks? We aren't trying to sell cloud to CIOs, <a href="http://www.netflix.com/jobs">it's all about hiring</a>, we are talking at engineer focused events in the Bay Area. Netflix is growing fast, pathfinding new technologies in the public cloud to support a very agile business model, and is trying to attract the best and brightest people. We use LinkedIn a lot when we search for positions, so <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/adriancockcroft">feel free to connect to me</a> if you think this could be interesting, or <a href="http://twitter.com/adrianco">follow @adrianco</a> on Twitter.
