organized by <a href="http://350.org">350.org</a> there are events all over the world. The significance of 350 is that it is the safe level of CO2 in the atmosphere. <a href="http://www.350.org/en/about/science">We are already at 390ppm</a>, which is why the climate is changing and extreme weather events are becoming common. The level is going up by 2ppm a year at the moment and the changes needed to reverse this haven't started, so its going to go much higher and have increasingly worse effects.<br /><br />Even if all you do is buy and start reading a copy of James Hansen's book <a href="http://www.stormsofmygrandchildren.com/">Storms of my Grandchildren</a> (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Storms-My-Grandchildren-Catastrophe-Humanity/dp/1608192008">you can get it instantly from the Kindle store</a>) it will help.<br /><br />Here is a useful discussion of "<a href="http://www.skepticalscience.com/The-value-of-coherence-in-science.html">The Value of Coherence in Science</a>" which is how you can tell what makes sense from what must be wrong. I'm a Physics graduate, and I was taught that science works by making predictions and testing them, and by eliminating incoherent propositions. i.e. if an argument contradicts itself it must be false. The denialist counter-arguments fail this test. To see why the denialist arguments are getting any air time at all, read<a href="http://www.merchantsofdoubt.org/"> Merchants of Doubt</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Climate-Cover-Up-Crusade-Warming-ebook/dp/B002Z14KWQ/ref=pd_sim_kinc_1?ie=UTF8&m=AG56TWVU5XWC2">Climate Cover Up</a>.<br /><br />For an example of incoherent and shoddy denialist work <a href="http://deepclimate.org/2010/09/26/strange-scholarship-wegman-report/">John Mashey has systematically deconstructed the Wegman Report</a> which was presented to Congress as an impartial study when it was nothing of the sort.
