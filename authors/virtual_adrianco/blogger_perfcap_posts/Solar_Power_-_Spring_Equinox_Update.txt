Title: Solar Power - Spring Equinox Update
URL: https://perfcap.blogspot.com/2010/03/solar-power-spring-equinox-update.html

Spring is here, and we just had a few clear days, shown below. The sunrise and sunset are about 12 hours apart. We installed the system just before the fall equinox, so we now have a good calibration of the output levels through the least sunny part of the year, from now on it will be interesting to track the output as we go to the longest day.<br /><br />Actual average output over the last 200 or so days is about 14.3 KWh/day. Yesterday was 22.5 KWh, and <a href="http://perfcap.blogspot.com/2009/12/solar-power-winter-solstice-and-new.html">at the winter solstice low point it was 16 KWh on a clear day</a> as previously blogged.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh6_CrcVTL8zs4EsQ-RdoHUI-2QMYTOo_LuN2kN7xjxnv2lhGEKifyIdWy46igdvcIOx_9EKIN74UAcSw0fdawsicnHmqn6coHAI828N86zaW77a6FAT4p7jLHQfwcxhZS3uBG0/s1600-h/Screen+shot+2010-03-19+at+12.45.33+PM.png"><img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 158px;" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh6_CrcVTL8zs4EsQ-RdoHUI-2QMYTOo_LuN2kN7xjxnv2lhGEKifyIdWy46igdvcIOx_9EKIN74UAcSw0fdawsicnHmqn6coHAI828N86zaW77a6FAT4p7jLHQfwcxhZS3uBG0/s320/Screen+shot+2010-03-19+at+12.45.33+PM.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5450433986073121682" /></a>
