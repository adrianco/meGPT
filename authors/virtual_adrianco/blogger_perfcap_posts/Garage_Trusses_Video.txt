On Tuesday a big truck had some difficulty delivering a 40ft trailer containing the roof framing trusses, but it was raining so that is all that happened.<br /><br />On Wednesday 21st April it started out dry, rained for a while then cleared up, but they did manage to put up all the trusses, and I made another stop-motion video of the work.<br /><br />Tuffshed aren't great at letting us know what is going to happen next, we have to call them or ask the workers. I think the next step is to put plywood sheeting on the roof, then get an inspector up to check that the nailing pattern is correct, then they can put the doors and windows in, tile the roof add the external trim and paint it. It should be much warmer and sunny for the next few days.<br /><br /><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/d7Q-suFmOZ8&hl=en_US&fs=1&rel=0"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/d7Q-suFmOZ8&hl=en_US&fs=1&rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object>
