I recently gave notice to eBay and start at <a href="http://www.netflix.com">Netflix</a> on May 7th. I've had a lot of fun working at <a href="http://labs.ebay.com">eBay Research Labs</a>, but I'm making a strategic move to a smaller company (about a tenth of the number of people as a technology organization) which makes it easier to take a broader role and develop skills and experience in new areas. I will be directing a few senior engineers who develop part of the Netflix web site as my primary role. Its an exciting new challenge!
