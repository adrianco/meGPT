Tuffshed turned up with their pre-built sections, assembled them and added some siding and the main door frame. Another stop-motion video on YouTube. It was wet over the weekend, and the ground is very soft, but we have a few dry and warm days in a row forecast, so I'm hoping it will dry out now.<br /><br /><object width="420" height="320"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/h3MmG6ixkSg&hl=en_US&fs=1&rel=0"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/h3MmG6ixkSg&hl=en_US&fs=1&rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="420" height="320"></embed></object>
