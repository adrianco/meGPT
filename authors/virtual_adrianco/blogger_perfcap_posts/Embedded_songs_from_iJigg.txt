This is a very nice embeddable player from iJigg, below is Continuum from my friends in Fractal, and also Smuggled Mutation by Estradasphere, which is from Palace of Mirrors, one of my most-played CDs in recent history. Its so varied and well played its impossible to get bored by it.<br /><br /><object width="315" height="80"><param name="movie" value="http://www.ijigg.com/jiggPlayer.swf?songID=C7CDEDPAA&Autoplay=1"><param name="scale" value="noscale" /><param name="wmode" value="transparent"><embed src="http://www.ijigg.com/jiggPlayer.swf?Autoplay=1&songID=C7CDEDPAA" width="315" height="80"  scale="noscale" wmode="transparent"></embed></object> <br /><br /><object width="315" height="80"><param name="movie" value="http://www.ijigg.com/jiggPlayer.swf?songID=D7E00P0&Autoplay=0"><param name="scale" value="noscale" /><param name="wmode" value="transparent"><embed src="http://www.ijigg.com/jiggPlayer.swf?Autoplay=0&songID=D7E00P0" width="315" height="80"  scale="noscale" wmode="transparent"></embed></object>
