Another stop motion video at 30s intervals shows most of the day's work. The tree that was falling over was pushed back the other way and cut up, and they added the parking "apron" in front of the garage.<br /><br />There is a 4ft wide walkway along the side of the garage by the house, so the main pad is 36 by 36ft. It slopes to the right by three inches over that width so it will drain. The walkway slopes away from the garage by one inch. The apron is 26ft deep, 36ft wide and slopes by 12 inches (4%). The driveway will connect to the side of the apron that is nearest the house.<br /><br /><object width="420" height="255"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/3EqiVgEcbsw&hl=en_US&fs=1&"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/3EqiVgEcbsw&hl=en_US&fs=1&" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="420" height="255"></embed></object>
