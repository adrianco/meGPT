Title: Configuring IPQoS for flow accounting
URL: https://perfcap.blogspot.com/2005/03/configuring-ipqos-for-flow-accounting.html

I spent some time today working my way through the manuals. What I want is to just have the accounting information about the network flows, with no complex QoS rules and minimum overhead. So far I got it configured, but I'm getting no output. No error messages, but no output - so my machine is giving me some sulky passive agressive treatment :-(<br /><br />I'm working on a Sun W2100z, which is a dual CPU Opteron system. It came with Solaris 9, but I got Solaris 10 loaded on it by feeding it a bunch of CDs. The hardest part was configuring the graphics display, it defaulted to something horrible with 256 colors. I had to use kdmconfig, but it took me a while to figure out a) that fbconfig is only for SPARC, and that there is an x86 command with a different name. b) that the system I have has a certain kind of NVidia card in it, c) what display resolution my non-Sun LCD screen supports, and d) that if I scrolled up the screen I could find options with 16M colors that look right.<br /><br />Its a nice box, not too big, fairly quiet, fast.
