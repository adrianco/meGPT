Title: My iPhone apps 2009
URL: https://perfcap.blogspot.com/2010/01/my-iphone-apps-2009.html

the apps that I use most frequently: Echofon, Skype, Newsstand, Instant Queue Add for Netflix, Amazon, Kindle, Pandora, WootWatch, CoPilot.<br /><br />In particular I get most of my news via rss feeds using Newsstand, which synchronizes very well with Google Reader on my laptop. I don't own a kindle, but whenever possible I buy books to read on my iPhone using the kindle app.
