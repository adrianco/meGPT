The successful candidate will be a self-motivated, intellectually curious individual. A Doctorate or experience working in a research environment, work with personalization algorithms, machine learning, adaptive systems, and statistical analysis would be a bonus. <span style="font-weight:bold;">Experience with large scale multithreaded Java applications is essential</span>.<br /><br />This is a hands-on individual contributor role, for example you may need to prototype or model a new concept, communicate it, architect a Hadoop cluster, write the code to load and analyze interesting data and build high performance scalable Java and SQL code to incorporate the results into the web site.</blockquote><br /><br />Netflix is a <span style="font-style:italic;">performance culture</span>. Everyone is located in Los Gatos CA, no teleworking, contractors or offshore development. Pay is at the top end of the scale for the SF Bay Area. Netflix is scaling the company by hiring the very best people in the industry. There are no interns or junior staff, minimal need for processes, we hire fully formed adults and give them <span style="font-style:italic;">freedom with responsibility</span>. Netflix is very focused, small enough to be fun and to know everyone and everything that is going on, yet big enough to be interesting, with a big impact in a very entertaining industry.
