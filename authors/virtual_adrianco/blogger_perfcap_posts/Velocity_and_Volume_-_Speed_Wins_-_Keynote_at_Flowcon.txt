Title: Velocity and Volume - Speed Wins - Keynote at Flowcon
URL: https://perfcap.blogspot.com/2013/12/velocity-and-volume-speed-wins-keynote.html

November 1st was the first ever Flowcon, held in San Francisco, a new event to focus on continuous delivery related development topics.<br />
<br />
I was honored to be asked to present as the opening keynote speaker, and I owe a big thank you to Jez Humble and Gene Kim for the invitation.<br />
<br />
The material I presented was less focused on Netflix related technologies than most of my talks, and instead looks at the challenges and motivations of speeding up the page of development. I also tried to provide a historical perspective of how the state of the art for software delivery has changed over the last few decades.<br />

There was a second chance to present these slides with a bit more time a few days later, and the slides for that are linked below. There's a bit more of an introduction, and a more discussion of tools on the end, but it's basically the same message.<br />
