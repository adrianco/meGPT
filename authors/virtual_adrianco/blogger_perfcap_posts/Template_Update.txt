Title: Template Update
URL: https://perfcap.blogspot.com/2007/01/template-update.html

I just realised that my blog wasn't displaying properly in Internet Explorer. I couldn't figure out why, so I upgraded to a fresh new Blogger.com template that has a lot more configurability, and dropped the ads etc back into it. The formatting is still a bit off, and it looks better in Flock/FireFox but at least the basic blocks are all in the right place now.<br /><br />The archive of old posts is also easier to navigate with the new template.
