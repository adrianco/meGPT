It also has a slot in the bottom end to take an iPod connector, which carries power, USB, stereo line level output etc. an antenna mounting hole at the top, and a retaining clip design to hold the LCD in place.<br /><br />This contains 2.6 cubic inches of ABS plastic, and used 1.4 cubic inches of support material, which costs about $40 in materials and took 8 hours to print at <a href="http://techshop.ws">Techshop</a>.
