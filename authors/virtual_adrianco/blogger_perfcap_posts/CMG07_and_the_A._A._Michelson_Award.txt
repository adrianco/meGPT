From the <a href="http://www.cmg.org/national/michelson-nominations.html">Computer Measurement Group website</a>:<br /><br /><blockquote>Each year, CMG considers exceptional individuals who have made significant contributions to our profession over their entire professional careers as possible recipients of the A.A. Michelson Award.     <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Abraham_Michelson"> Albert Abraham Michelson</a>, for whom the award is named, was known for his outstanding technical accomplishments in measuring the speed of light as well as for his role as a teacher and inspirer of others. CMG presents this lifetime achievement award to a single individual to recognize and encourage the same combination of technical excellence and professional contributions found in only an exceptional few.</p></blockquote><p></p>The recipient is nominated and chosen by <a href="http://www.cmg.org/national/michelson-awards.html">the past winners</a>, and it has been granted to one person every year since 1974. This year I was very honored to be the recipient! It was announced on Monday 3rd December, at the start of the CMG07 conference. I gave an acceptance speech, that I have <a href="http://perfcap.blogspot.com/2007/12/a-michelson-award-acceptance-speech.html">summarized into a blog post</a>.<br /><br />Thanks to everyone who has supported me over the years, reading the blogs, papers and books; coming to training classes; the engineers at Sun who fixed my bugs and added the features I lobbied for to make Solaris more measurable; and the friends, mentors and mentees that I have worked with for many years.<br /><br />Cheers!<br />Adrian<br /><br /><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>
