I'm looking for someone who has been benchmarking and testing web services/cloud performance to work in Los Gatos CA, no remote work, sorry.<br /><br />For the uninitiated, PAE = Performance Applications Engineering, one of the groups I was in years ago at Sun that built benchmarks and did performance analysis for a living. Snorcle = Sun + Oracle sinking beneath the waves...<br /><br />This is a great time to join Netflix, we are growing fast, there are a lot of open positions and we pay very well for star players.
