I met Jim last year when he gave a talk at eBay. His sailboat went missing, and a lot of people have collaborated to allow up to date satellite images to be posted on the web for anyone to take a look at and see if they can see anything that might be his boat.<br /><br />My (ex-Sun DE) friend Geoff Arnold now works at Amazon, he blogged that they have configured a web service called Mechanical Turk to support parcelling out the work of looking at images. If you already have an Amazon.com account, then <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">sign up</span> for the service takes a couple of clicks.<br /><br />I hunted through images for a while, and found a cargo ship, <span onclick="BLOG_clickHandler(this)" class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">that's</span> all :-(<br /><br /><a href="http://geoffarnold.com/?p=1329">Geoff's blog</a><br /><a href="http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2007/02/help_find_jim_gray.html">Werner's blog</a><br /><a href="http://www.mturk.com/mturk/preview?groupId=J0XZ58STDWJZ5QY4F9M0">Search for Jim</a><br /><br />Please take a look yourself and pass the Mechanical Turk search for Jim URL on...
