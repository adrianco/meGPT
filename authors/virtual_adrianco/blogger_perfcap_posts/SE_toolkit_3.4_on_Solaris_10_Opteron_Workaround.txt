Title: SE toolkit 3.4 on Solaris 10 Opteron Workaround
URL: https://perfcap.blogspot.com/2005/10/se-toolkit-34-on-solaris-10-opteron.html

The current 3.4 build of SE is available from <a href="http://www.sunfreeware.com/setoolkit.html">the sunfreeware site</a> and supports Solaris 8, 9 and 10 for SPARC and x86. It also includes full source code of the interpreter for the first time.<br />However it only includes 32bit x86 support, and when run on a 64bit Solaris kernel on an Opteron system, it will fail to run. This is due to the return value from the <span style="font-weight:bold;">isalist</span> command returning <span style="font-weight:bold;">amd64</span> as the first word, rather than <span style="font-weight:bold;">pentium</span>. You can get it going with a workaround by changing the startup script /opt/RICHPse/bin/se to match the string "*pentium*" rather than "pentium*". This lets the 32bit x86 binary run on the 64bit <span style="font-weight:bold;">amd64</span> system, and most of the scripts will still work. Some that try to access the kernel directly via<span style="font-weight:bold;">kvm</span> will fail, but most scripts use <span style="font-weight:bold;">kstat</span> which doesn't need 64bit accesses.<br />The real fix is to use the source to compile an amd64 build....
