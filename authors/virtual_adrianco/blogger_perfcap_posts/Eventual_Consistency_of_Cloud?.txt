Title: Eventual Consistency of Cloud?

Lori MacVittie wrote that eventually cloud standards will converge around the private cloud standards (RT @swardley). I disagree, and there are several examples I can think of that point to the opposite conclusion, that public cloud will be the standard, and AWS will continue to dominate. <a href="http://devcentral.f5.com/weblogs/macvittie/archive/2010/08/18/the-inevitable-eventual-consistency-of-cloud-computing.aspx">The original article is here</a>.<br /><br />The first point of disagreement is the claim that public clouds aren't getting the input they need from customers to mature their services, because real enterprise customers aren't running in the public cloud. Well, here at Netflix, we are giving Amazon exactly that kind of input. We use every feature they have, we are driving them hard and Amazon is taking the input and improving their product rapidly in ways that benefit all the users of AWS.<br /><br />My main disagreement is the claim that lots of individual IT departments will converge on a single standard that will win out over public cloud standards. I find this highly implausible, there are a host of vendors feeding technology to enterprise clouds, and they will all do the usual vendor thing of looking for ways to lock in the customer, even if they base on the same standards their implementations will be different. Here's an example, the "private" Enterprise Unix variants Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, IRIX, OSF/1 etc. are all based on the same Unix standards, however the "public" alternatives are Linux and BSD, and Linux has won the mind share in this space. I see Linux as an analogy for the public cloud in the sense that there is a very low barrier to adoption. For Linux, you can download it to run on any old computer for nothing, learn to use it, then build very low cost solutions out of it. For AWS, for a few dollars on the existing Amazon account you use to buy books etc, you can explore all the features and learn to build very powerful systems in a few hours. This has produced a large population of very productive engineers, who know how to use AWS, Linux and other open source tools to solve problems rapidly at low cost using the same tools. In contrast, if every enterprise cloud moves ahead by solving their problems independently they will produce a variety of architectures, each optimized to their own problem, and with their own tooling, and a very small number of people who know how to run each variant. You will also find that every company also uses the public cloud to get stuff done more quickly and cheaply than the IT department, so that will become the common standard.<br /><br />Part of the thinking behind Netflix' move to the cloud is that large public cloud providers like Amazon will have far more engineers working on making their infrastructure robust, scalable, well automated and secure than any individual enterprise could afford. By using AWS we are leveraging a huge investment made by Amazon, and paying a small amount for it on a month by month basis. We also get to efficiently allocate resources, for example how much does it cost to provision a large cage of equipment in a new datacenter and how long does it take from deciding to do it, to having it running reliably in production? Let's say $10M and many months. Instead we could spend $10M on licensing more movies and TV shows to stream, and grow incrementally in the cloud. In a few months time we have more customers than if we spent the money up front on buying compute capacity and we just keep re-provisioning new instances in the cloud, so we never end up with a datacenter full of inappropriately sized or obsolete equipment. At present, Netflix' growth is accelerating, so it is difficult to guess in advance how much capacity to invest in, but we have already flat-lined our datacenter capacity, and have all incremental capacity happening on AWS. For example, we can just fire up a few thousand instances for a week to encode all the new movies we just bought the rights to, then stop paying for them until another big deal closes. Likewise on The Oscars Awards night, there is a big spike in web traffic, and we can grow on the day and shrink afterwards as needed without planning it and buying hardware a long time in advance.<br /><br />While the other public and private cloud vendors are competing to come up with standards, we are finding that resumes from the kind of engineers we want to hire already reference their experience with AWS as a de-facto cloud standard. It's also easier to attract the best people if they will learn transferable skills and work on the very latest technologies.<br /><br />That might sound like a lock-in, but a well designed architecture is layered, and the actual AWS dependencies are very localized in our code base. The bet on the end game is that in coming years, other cloud vendors produce large scale AWS compatible offerings (full featured, not just EC2 and S3), and a very large scale multi-vendor low cost public cloud market is created. Then even a large and fast growing enterprise like Netflix will be an insignificant and ever smaller proportion of the cloud. By definition, you can't be an insignificant proportion of your own private cloud....
