Title: Pandora Prog Channel

<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I've been trying Pandora on and off for Internet music for a while, and attended a talk by CEO Tim Westergren last week, which got me to try it again. They are continuously improving their algorithms for choosing music, and I was trying to make a channel that would serve me interesting new music alongside some of my favourite experimental "Prog Rock" bands. It seems to be working much better, and I keep tuning the channel by skipping tracks that I don't like and giving thumbs up to the ones I do. The nice thing is you can listen to my channel, even though you don't get exactly the same songs as I do, there should be an interesting mix of King Crimson, Zappa, Estradasphere, and many other bands playing music you won't hear often. Its easy to make your own channel (it takes less training to make a more mainstream channel) and its the best way I've found to discover completely new music.<br/>  </p>  <p><a href="http://www.pandora.com/?sc=sh59488715848528731" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" target="_blank">http://www.pandora.com/?sc<WBR/>=sh59488715848528731</a></p>  <p>Enjoy...</p>  <p style="text-align: right; font-size: 8px">Blogged with <a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" target="_new" title="Flock">Flock</a></p></div>
