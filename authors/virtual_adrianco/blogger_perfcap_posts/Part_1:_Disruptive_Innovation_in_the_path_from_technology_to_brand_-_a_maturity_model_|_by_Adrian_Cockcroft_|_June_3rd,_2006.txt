Products aim to fill a need in a market, products that are disruptive innovations also reshape the market and markets tend to evolve in a series of discontinuous steps as they mature. The phrase "crossing the chasm" has been used to describe these changes, and "early adopters" are the people who first move a market to a new phase.<br /><br />In the next few posts I'm going to describe a generic maturity model that applies to many markets, and show how disruptive innovations may drive a market into a more mature phase. I got the initial idea of looking at markets in this way from Dave Nocera of Innovativ in a presentation he gave at SUPerG in early 2004. He used video as an example, with the move from VCR to Video rental to Online. I have extended that example, and come up with a generic maturity model based on it, which I also apply to the Telco industry.
