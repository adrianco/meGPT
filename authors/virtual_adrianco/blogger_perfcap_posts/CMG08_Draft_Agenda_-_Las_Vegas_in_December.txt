URL: https://perfcap.blogspot.com/2008/08/cmg08-draft-agenda-las-vegas-in.html

<a href="http://www.cmg.org/blog/home/04">CMG just published the draft agenda for their annual conference on their website</a>. This year I will be on a panel with other Michelson Award winners discussing Visualization, and probably on a second panel talking about Unix performance. I'm also planning to repeat the half day training seminars on Unix Performance, and Capacity Planning with Free Tools. <br /><br />See you there!
