The tutorials are the latest update of my Solaris/Linux performance metrics and tuning class, and Capacity Planning with Free Tools.<br /><br />I'm also giving an invited speaker talk on <a href="http://www.millicomputing.com">Millicomputing</a>, and have a nice big time slot, so will cover both the mobile and enterprise aspects in some depth, with time for discussion.<br /><br />I hope to see you there...
