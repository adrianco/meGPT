Title: SEtoolkit and XEtoolkit releases
URL: https://perfcap.blogspot.com/2007/04/setoolkit-and-xetoolkit-releases.html

The <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">SEtoolkit</span> was developed in 1993 by Rich <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_1">Pettit</span>, and I used it as a way to prototype many new tools and ideas over the years. Its a Solaris specific performance tool scripting language that supports very rapid development of new tools. The <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">SEtoolkit</span> has been widely deployed as the Solaris collector for the popular system performance monitor <a href="http://www.orcaware.com"><span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">Orca</span></a>. Rich gave up development of the <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4">SEtoolkit</span> a few years ago, put the code into open source  under <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_5">GPL</span>, and <a href="http://www.setoolkit.org/cms/">its now available via <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_6">sourceforge</span></a>, where it is being maintained by <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_7">Dagobert</span> <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_8">Michelsen</span>. A bug in the <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_9">SEtoolkit</span> was causing it to crash when used with complex disk subsystems, and this has now been fixed in the SE3.4.1 release (April 10<span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_10">th</span>, 2007).<br /><br />Meanwhile, Rich has been trying to make a multi-platform (Solaris, Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_11">OSX</span>, HP-<span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_12">UX</span>, <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_13">AIX</span>) version of SE for a long time, and finally gave up trying to implement his own language, and based his latest development, the <a href="http://www.xetoolkit.com"><span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_14">XEtoolkit</span>, on Java 5. The first full release <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_15">XEtoolkit</span> 1.0 came out on April 15<span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_16">th</span>, 2007</a>. The code is released and supported under both open source and commercial licenses, by Rich's new company - <a href="http://www.captivemetrics.com/">Captive Metrics.</a> The <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_17">GPL</span> license allows full free use of the provided tools, and development of new  and derived tools that are also contributed to the community. The commercial license allows custom <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_18">XEtoolkit</span> development for proprietary tools, with a higher level of support.<br /><br />The <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_19">XEtoolkit</span> 1.0 release doesn't support HP-<span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_20">UX</span> or <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_21">AIX</span>, but <span class="blsp-spelling-error" id="SPELLING_ERROR_22">AIX</span> support is coming soon. I encourage you to try it out, give Rich some feedback and make it worth his while to continue. He's one of the very best programmers and performance tool architects I've ever met....
