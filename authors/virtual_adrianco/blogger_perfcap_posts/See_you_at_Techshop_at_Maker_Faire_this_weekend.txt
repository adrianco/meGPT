I've been using <a href="http://techshop.ws">Techshop</a> to make cases for my homebrew phone on their 3D Printer, and I signed up for annual membership since I have a few other projects to work on (e.g. TIG welding some modifications to my <a href="http://www.abarth.itgo.com/pic/124rally/124rally05.jpg">Fiat 124 Abarth Rally replica</a> :-)<br /><br />I'm going to be at Maker Faire in San Mateo this weekend, helping explain the 3D printer to attendees at the Techshop pavillion, and hanging out with Matt on the <a href="http://hbmobile.org">SVHMPC</a> booth. I'm on duty from 2pm onwards both Saturday and Sunday for Techshop so I should be easy to find and I'd be happy to chat about how to make mobile phone cases or <a href="http://millicomputing.blogspot.com">millicomputing</a> or whatever.
