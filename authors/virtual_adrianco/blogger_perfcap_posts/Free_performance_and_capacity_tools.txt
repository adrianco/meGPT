Title: Free performance and capacity tools
URL: https://perfcap.blogspot.com/2005/07/free-performance-and-capacity-tools.html

What free tools do you use for performance and capacity planning work? I'm particularly interested in figuring out combinations of tools that work well together.<br /><br />Mario Jauvin and I are signed up to present a workshop this december at <a href="http://www.cmg.org">CMG05</a> in Florida on performance monitoring and capacity planning with free tools. I know a lot about some of the tools, but it would be useful to get some input on the relative usage level of what is available.<br /><br />Here is a list of the kind of tools I'm interested in:<br /><br />Orca, <a href="http://www.orcaware.com/">www.orcaware.com</a> data collection using SE toolkit etc. and web display using rrdtool<br />BigBrother <a href="http://www.bb4.org/">www.bb4.org</a> and BigSister, <a href="http://bigsister.graeff.com/">bigsister.graeff.com</a> which do you use and why?<br />OpenNMS, <a href="http://opennms.org/wiki">opennms.org/wiki</a> Large scale network management system<br />Nagios, <a href="http://www.nagios.org/about">www.nagios.org/about</a> Simpler and smaller scale network element management<br />SE Toolkit, <a href="http://www.sunfreeware.com/setoolkit.html">www.sunfreeware.com/setoolkit.html</a> Solaris specific instrumentation and tools<br />R, <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">www.r-project.org</a> statistical analysis and graphing package<br />MySQL, <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">www.mysql.com</a> database for storing large amounts of performance data<br />PDQ, <a href="http://www.perfdynamics.com/">www.perfdynamics.com</a> toolkit for building analytical queueing models in C or Perl<br />Ganglia, <a href="http://ganglia.sourceforge.net/">ganglia.sourceforge.net</a> large scale distributed system monitoring<br /><br />Does the license model matter? There is a wide variety of licenses for free tools, from an absence of any license, through GPL to free use of commercially owned products. Do you use anything that is free, or does it have to meet some criteria?<br /><br />I'm inviting a lot more input than I have before, add comments to this post or send me messages, I'll summarize, and I'll describe the tools in more detail and how they inter-relate in future postings.<br /><br />Cheers Adrian
