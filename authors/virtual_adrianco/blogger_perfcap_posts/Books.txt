Web Services Explained - Solutions and Applications for the Real World by Joe Clabby - Prentice Hall 2002
<br />
<br />An introductory primer suitable for less-technical managers, but with good coverage of what the technology is supposed to be for, issues and gotchas.
<br />
<br />
<br />Developing Enterprise Web Services - An Architects Guide by Sandeep Chatterjee and James Webber - Prentice Hall 2004
<br />
<br />Much more in depth and up to date coverage. I'm still reading it, more comments later.
