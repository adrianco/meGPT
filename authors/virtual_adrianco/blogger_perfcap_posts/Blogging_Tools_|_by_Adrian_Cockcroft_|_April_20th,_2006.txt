I've been using blogger for the last 18 months, it was an easy way to get started but now I don't see some of the features I want. The basic service has changed very little in that time, so it doesn't seem to be getting much investment and development.<br /><br />The three missing features I see in other blogs are tags, a blogroll, and posting categories.<br /><br />I want to have an easy way to add a series of tags to each blog entry, without having to create custom html. I did it once the hard way and don't usually bother.<br /><br />I'd like a blogroll so that people can see which blogs I think are worth reading, but I don't want to edit my html template to get one, I want to import OPML or have a table to edit.<br /><br />I'd like to be able to separate categories so that I can label rants like this separately from technical info on capacity planning, thoughts on the industry, personal stuff.<br /><br />I like the web based blogger service, I can post from anywhere using any device (I've posted to blogger from Linux, Solaris, Windows, Mac and Treo/palmOS). I don't want to host my own blog or have to install a blogging tool.<br /><br />I use <a href="http://www.bloglines.com">bloglines </a>as an aggregator to read blogs, I could also use bloglines to host my own blog, since it does seem to have some of these features, and it would make referring easier.<br /><br />What other options are out there, is there a slightly better blogger competitor that I should check out? Is there a way to migrate existing entries to a new blog? Comments requested...<br /><br />Cheers Adrian
