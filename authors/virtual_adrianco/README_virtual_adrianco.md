rm.pdf and caphi.pdf - full source of books on Resource Management and Capacity Planning I contributed chapters to in 1999 and 2000 for Sun Microsystems. It was distributed as a pdf on a CDROM as part of the Sun BluePrints series.

My Sun Performance and Tuning book was published by Sun Press/Prentice Hall and I don't have it in pdf form. I wrote it using FrameMaker and would have to get a copy of that running to print it. I may do that at some point.

I was active on Twitter from 2008-2022 and include an extract of tweet conversations from my twitter archive here, and the code that generated it. Any issues or requests for the full public archuve, let me know.
